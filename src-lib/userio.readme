README for userio.f 

Two versions included, userio1.f userio2.f

The g77 compiler objects to the format statments in userio2.f, the work-around
is to use userio1.f.

If you have ifort (or other compiler) copy userio2.f to userio.f (or link it)
If you have g77                       copy userio1.f to userio.f (or link it)

The Makefiles expect a file called userio.f to be in this directory
